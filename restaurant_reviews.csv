FLV202,5,"Totally in love with the Auro of the place, really beautiful and quite fancy at the same time. The ambience is very pure and gives a sense of positivity throughout. Outdoor and indoor interior are quite quaint and cute. Love the open kitchen idea and there whole marketplace ideology. Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation. The food is really amazing specially the pizza straight from the oven and the hummus and pita bread are quite delicious too. If you're looking for a classy yet soothing Italian place in Delhi,Fatjar is a go to for you!"
SAV303,5,"Kailash colony is brimming with small cafes now. I happened to visit this beauty for lunch and was amazed with the 1st impression it made.  We started with Falafel & Pita and Margherita Pizza. Safe to say, Margherita pizza was the best choice of the day. Its made freshly in front of you in the Wood Fired oven. The taste was exquisite and I would recommend this to anybody who plans to visit this outlet. I could come here just to have that Pizza. Hummus, Pita and Falafel were a good side dish while we ordered the next couple of dishes. We moved on to order Fussili Alfredo. This white sauce fussili pasta was good but could not be compared to the pizza we had earlier.  In the end, we went for Frozen Yoghurt with Honey. It is recommended to have it with honey, which will do wonders to the frozen yoghurt!  This place turned out to be quite peaceful and the plants enhanced its beauty."

EAT456,5,"Had a great experience in the restaurant food was fabulous, staff was nice. Hotel staff seems very professional specially the team at front desk although I was not staying there but they helped me with few of my quarries. Was dining with my kids and the team member at front desk young guy came with some kids book and gave it to my little child. It was a wonderful experience at Holiday inn and the staff was super . I was little worried as using the hotel first time for dining but the staff made it more comfortable. Will strongly recommend this and special thanks to people working at desk do not remember his name but he was a manager in the lobby who suggested us kylin for food and thanks to him that we enjoyed meal at kylin and now it's my first choice for food."
RST-A1,5,"We came across Perch by accident and had dinner there on two separate occasions, having enjoyed it so much the first time round. There is no doubt that it has a strong European emphasis, although results in fantastic, modern food and attentive service that was amongst the best that we've experienced here.  The Indian Sauvignon Blanc was very acceptable, rather than the more expensive European alternatives, and there was a good range of cocktails, mocktails and beers. Decor was stylish but simple, ambience was good with lively, tasteful music to suit the meal. All food we ordered was good, and we've taken a menu home to replicate some of our favourite dishes. Have two appetisers or one main each, a couple of puddings are good to share on a small table.  Half carafe of wine, half of Sangria, two beers, five appetisers and two puddings including taxes and service about £75. "
DSH404,5,"We went there on birthday special time. A nice place for evening drinks and food. Spend your time with friends in this place over conversation. The interior is friendly and not intimidating like any other pubs.The place has very soft lighting and the second floor, especially, has a cozy feel. No issues on the decor/service. we ordered a Pulled Duck Salad. The Mulled Wine was more or less as expected - star anise/cinnamon loaded, sweet, with a floating orange slice. The Holiday Coffee was infused with a heavy dose of whiskey, topped with whipped cream and grated candied orange. Both of these items were incredibly comforting on the cold evening. The pulled duck was prepared and seasoned well but the meat had been marinated with too much balsamic vinegar and tasted that way. Can't call this place very cost-effective either - the season specials were surely priced over the value-for-money mark."
GRT505,3,"Our visit to Green Bites on a busy Saturday evening offered a mixed experience. The service was a bit slow despite a few attentive staff members. The menu had a variety of options, and while some dishes were tasty, others were just average. The prices were reasonable, resulting in an overall neutral impression"
MMM606,3,"At Bella Cuisine, the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff created a welcoming setting. The menu had a good selection, though the service was a bit inconsistent. While some dishes were flavorful, others lacked a distinctive taste. The pricing was fair, making it an overall neutral dining experience"
FST707,3,"Our dinner at Spice Haven provided a neutral experience. The service was efficient, with attentive staff members. The menu offered a range of options, and the dishes were generally well-prepared, if not exceptional. The prices were reasonable for the quality of food and service, resulting in a balanced impression"
SPL808,3,"DineXpress, with its casual vibe, offered a neutral dining experience. The service was prompt, though the menu lacked variety. The food was decent, without any standout dishes. The affordable prices made it a reasonable choice for a casual meal, contributing to an overall neutral impression"
QIK909,3,"Our recent visit to SeaFlavors had its ups and downs. The seaside ambiance was pleasant, and the staff was friendly. However, the service was a bit slow, and the menu, while extensive, didn't deliver consistent quality. Prices were average, resulting in a neutral overall dining experience"
TST010,3,"At Urban Tastes, the modern decor and attentive service contributed to a neutral dining experience. The menu offered a variety of options, though the execution of some dishes fell short. Prices were on par with the overall quality, making it an average choice for a casual meal."
DLY111,1,"Notwithstanding its location and potential for attracting a trendy, upmarket crowd, the Coast Cafe's characterization of a boutique destination for casual dining is a rather misleading one. I'd visited the place on a Thursday evening after work and walked in to what resembled a restaurant with a bunch of waiters spread across the floor. One was sitting by the stairwell listening to music, another was supposedly taking an order on the telephone, and a third was cleaning glasses at the bar. Neither felt necessary or important to welcome a patron or pay attention, least of all provide directions to a table for two people. Nonetheless, after making myself comfortable and waiting for a considerable amount of time to be catered to, I was compelled to call upon a waiter and request for a glass of water and a menu card. Both dishes (i.e., prawns in chili olive oil and a fish fry) arrived much after I drowned a glass of fresh orange and basil juice in spite of explicitly requesting the entire order to arrive together. As I was prepared to wrap up, leave, and pay the bill, one of the service staff requested me to climb a flight of stairs to the building's third floor to pay by debit card as ""their machine was immovable"". I would have been happy to leave a positive review with constructive feedback for the Coast Café to take note of and improve upon, but a brazen lack of any understanding of maintaining and upholding hospitality standards whatsoever would leave any customer with a lot to say albeit devoid of any confidence or trust in the management's ability to deliver."
ZZZ222,1,"I went to Pluck (Hotel Pullman) on a Friday night. We were a group of 7 adults and 1 infant. There weren’t many people in the restaurant when we reached around 10:20PM and very soon the ones that were there also left. So eventually it was just all of us on one table and after that no one else came. Some person came to our table and introduced himself as Ashish and told us that he would take care of our table. The menus were in a tablet which seemed impressive. We were coming straight from the airport after our journey and were hungry and tired too. We quickly ordered 3 set menus, some food items and some drinks. The service from the very beginning was very slow. Apart from Ashish, we could see about 4-5 more waiters inside the restaurant; but when it came to servicing our table, it was only Ashish who was doing it and couldn’t do it effectively. We kept waiting for our order; we had to call him so many times to remind him to bring our order, particularly the next dish of our set menu. Looked like the chef also couldn’t manage. The tomato and coriander consommé (more commonly known as tomato dhaniya shorba in India) was a big disappointment! There were few pieces of tomato and coriander (or some greens) and he gave some sort of liquid to pour over it which was bland, watery and didn’t give the soup any taste. The organic quinoa broccoli cake that I got was burnt/over cooked and I left it. The pan roasted lamb Loin that was ordered for the second time was undercooked. Some of the food items that we got were decent in taste but the service level was so poor that the overall experience was very disappointing. We were in the restaurant for almost 2 hours, only waiting for our food to come, with only one person looking after the needs of 8 people! And in the end came the bill which was a bomb (Price for one person came out to approx INR3,000). It seemed an absurd figure, considering the extremely poor service that we received on a Friday night at a Fine Dining restaurant of a renowned hotel near the airport. I would not recommend this place to a family, especially if you are coming back from or going to the airport; you might just end up with a long wait!"
CRV333,1,"SERVICE HORRENDOUS!!!!! Listen to the reviews. Sandwich was decent enough (maybe because I was soooo hungry after a hectic day out) well presented but the service put me off completely. 12 servers on the floor including the manager and not one person came over to check back to make sure all was okay with our meals. All hanging around talking. And when I say 12 that’s not even an exaggeration. Not a 5 star service. And certainly not a 5 star hotel. We did ask for bottled water and when poured in to a glass you could see tiny bubbles forming and microscopic imperfections on the glass because it was so warm. I asked for cold water and I was told they did not have any? I explained that I will not be drinking the warm water after waiting 15 minutes a new bottle came out...coldish.. 5 star ? And they do not have cold water! Ridiculous. Maybe for further tourist this could be a preference, cold water or temperature. 3700 rupees €46 for two sandwiches, bottled water and terrible service! Certainly not worth it. I reckon the street food stalls would give a better service then here "
LSH444,1,"Impolite and worst ever treatment towards customer by service staff and manager. Went there with my wife and another couple. Was provided a table first. Afterwards we requested a seperate table for me and my wife so that we could give privacy to the newly wed couple. We were outrightly rejected a second table even when the entire restaurant was empty. We assured that we shall vacate the table as and when your guest comes but they refused bluntly. The manager also refused to let us sit on a vacant table because of his high headedness. I said i shall leave the restaurant if that is the behavior they show towards there guests to which they said you can leave if you wish. This was an outright experience of racism and outcast felt by me and my wife wherein they werent affected in disrespecting their customer.  Moreover the reason i felt that happened was because on the very first moment that we took seat at the table we asked for regular water when the waiter was asking for still or sparkling water. I strongly feel that they made a perception about us and were not at all intereated in serving us. Worst ever restaurant experience i have ever felt across in my life, such kind of instance i havent come across abroad and was shocked to experience in my home country. Racism and High Headedness "
PIZ555,1,"Whilst staying at the Welcolmhotel Dwarka we visited Pavillion 75 expecting great things but we were disappointed. The place has great trip advisor reviews so we had high expectations that were sadly not met.  What really ruined our nice meal was the self service. A waiter gave us (a party of 5) two tablets to look at the menu on. Unlike with proper menus, where everyone can browse at their own speed we had to share a tablet between 5. We asked the waiter for more tablets and were given one. After we had eventually all used the tablets to browse and input our orders on to one tablet the tablet then had an error message and froze. We used the other tablet to order and that one ran out of battery. We were hungry after a long day travelling this was stressful. Eventually one of the waiters came over and took details of our order. I really disliked this way of ordering food, and would not use the restaurant again because of this.  The table was also dirty, there was dust and bits of fluff on the table and cloth napkins and my aunt was given a chipped glass which she discovered upon taking a drink. We told the waiter and he apologised and got us a new glass but again, this just really made our experience a disappointment.  Very disappointed as seems to have good reviews, maybe we came on a bad day but we didn't like the menu/way of ordering, the table was dirty and a member of our party was given a chipped glass."
BRR666,1,"At this restaurant the staff is extremely rude, they try to push the customers around. We made a booking for 7 people and then they put us on a table which is big enough for four and when we said this table only can seat 6 people that also with great difficulty they said they will add another chair to it as if 7 year old kids are coming to have dinner. The staff is so unprofessional and ill-trained it is unbelievable. One of my friends wanted to do sheesha so we asked them if we could shift upstairs and first they kept on saying no and then suddenly agreed and then kept on bugging us to shift outside quickly. The outside table was even smaller and when we said it they could light on the heater which was next to the seating, they said the heater is broken. Shocking the kind of restaurant this is. The we were having our food, suddenly a cat runs underneath the seating and my friend almost spilled hot coffee on herself. When we complained to the staff they were least bothered. It took sheesha almost 30 minutes to come after it was ordered, when we complained how come it took so long, the waiter answered back that there were 4 sheeshas ordered before us and it takes time, never heard a response like this. Un-trained staff can only answered back to customers like that. The food is very poor, don't even try the vietnamese chicken it looks horrible and tastes bad too. As we were eating another cat ran over the seating and by this time all of us had really lost our cool and got up and decided to leave. The waiter started running after us with the bill as if we were going to leave without paying. Also, it was funny couple of waiters came up to us and said please make a huge noise about the cats as the owner is least bothered about hyegine in this restaurant. I hope the cats don't run through people's food in the kitchen or on the tables. It is natural how bad this restaurant is as the owners are least bothered about the quality of service or food or experience. Please avoid at all cost. Not worth it."
CNF777,1,"Splendid location, above poor experience  I heard alot about this place over social media and many knowns but for me it was a place which made me shamefull among my family. The thursday evening started Started with a sleepy shabby looking guy Mr. Virender who was sleeping and was shoked when we entered the reception having no gesture to even stand and welcome. Then we were escorted to the restaurant by another guy where the restaurant manager (I guess) alloted us a table in open place though restaurant inside was really unoccupied by anyone. Then after almost 20mins later menu cards were presented. We ordered two beers and a whisky. Thank god it was quick service though no standard procedure of service is there. Not even asking for temperature and with or without froth in glass service. No knowledge of right way to serve food and wine as per standard service etiquettes rather they are like falling on us or serving from a wrong side. No proper cover and cutlary as per the meal and drinks. No knowldege of handing glass and cutlery. Really shamefull.... You guys are charging way more than any other fine dining restaurants and claiming to be 5star and under a brand welcomheritage... Food is awsome..but service is pathetic. I won’t suggest this place to anyone after this shamefull evening."
